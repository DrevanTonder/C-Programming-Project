# C# Programming Project
## Description
This is a simple graphical user interface that will read a text file and display the
contents on screen. The program will then allow alterations to be made to the “Current Count” field
only, and when the required adjustments have been made, the text file is adjusted (or a new text file
is written) with the adjusted amounts being represented.
